    "The numerical gradient is very simple to compute using the finite difference approximation, but th downside is that it is approximate(since we have to pick a small value of h, while the true gradient is defined as the limit as h goes to zero), and that it is very computationally expensive to compute. The second way to compute the gradient is analytically using Calculus, which allows us to derice a dirct formular for the gradient (no approximations) that is also very fast to compute. However, unlike the numerical gradient it can be more error prone to implement, which is why in practice it is very commmon to compute the analytic gradient and compare it to the numerical gradient to check the correctness of your implementation. This is called a gradient check"
