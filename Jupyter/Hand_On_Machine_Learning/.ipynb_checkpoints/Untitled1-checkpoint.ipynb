Incremental PCA is also useful online tasks, when you need to apply PCA on the fly, every time a new instance arrives. Randomized PCA is usedful when you want to considerably reduct dimensionality and the dataset fits in memory; in this case, it is much faster than regular PCA. Finally, Kerner PCA is useful for nonliner datasets."

Alternatively, if you are using dimensionality reduction as a preprocessing step before another Machine Learning algorithm (e.g., a Random Forest classifier), then you can simply measure the performance of that second algorithm; if dimensionality reduction did not lose too much information, then the algorithm should perform just as well as when using the original dataset."
